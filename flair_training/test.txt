He O
retired O
from O

knew O
immediately O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
do O
next O

Having O
grown O
up O
in O
a O
Buddhist B-NORP
family, O
Drachom B-PERSON
had O
been O
practising O
the O
religion O
since O
his O
teens O

He O
studied O
at O
the O
Amitabha B-ORG
Buddhist I-ORG
Centre I-ORG
in O
Geylang B-GPE
and O
eventually O
became O
its O
vice-president O
. O

As O
a O
soldier, O
he O
would O
wake O
up O
at O
4am B-TIME
every O
morning O
to O
pray O
before O
leaving O
for O

Buddhism O
was O
his O
"source O
of O
strength", O
the O
force O
that O
pushed O
him O
through O
demanding O
job O
. O

So O
for O
Drachom, O
the O
"natural O
progression" O
was O
to O
become O
a O
monk O
. O
Drachom B-PERSON

"The O
purpose O
of O
being O
a O
monk O
is O
to O
realise O
your O
potential, O
and O
in O
the O

help O
as O
many O

possible," O
he O
said O

This O
begs O
the O

is O
there O
no O

an O

is O
designed O
to O
be O
non-invasive, O

and O
most O

Because O
it O

" O
senescence O
. O

Perplexed, O
I O
wondered O
: O
What O
does O
"senescence" O
mean O
? O

To O
put O
it O
simply, O
senescence O
refers O
to O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
cell O
ageing, O
in O
which O
cells O
age O
and O
stop O
dividing O
. O

This O
decreased O
ability O
to O
renew O
and O
repair O
can O
result O
in O
the O
appearance O
of O
ageing O
signs O
such O
as O
wrinkles, O
loss O
skin O
elasticity, O
changes O
texture O
. O

Chanel B-ORG
has O
been O
studying O
senescence O
for O

; O
it O
is O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
its O
skin O

Findings O

have O
uncovered O
potent O
ingredients O
capable O
of O
combating O
senescence, O
which O
been O
integrated O

It O
ranks O
as O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL

claiming O
between B-CARDINAL
300 I-CARDINAL

. O

Despite O
its O
deadly O
nature, O
stomach O
cancer O
often O
evades O
early O
detection O
since O
symptoms O
rarely O
manifest O
. O

Consequently, O
around B-CARDINAL
two-thirds I-CARDINAL
of O
stomach O
cancer O
patients O
receive O
a O
diagnosis O
only O
in O
the O
advanced O

Optoacoustic O
imaging O
- O
a O

technology O

both O
laser O

ultrasound O
allows O
surgeons O
to O
determine O
an O
incomplete O
tumour O
excision O
by O
providing O
critical O
layer O
of O
information O
. O

It O
is O
used O
to O
complement O
the O
current O
methods O
of O
verifying O
tumour O
excision O
" O
such O
as O
X-rays O

In O

exact O
relationship O
has O
yet O
be O
determined O
as O
further O
investigations O
into O

need O
take O
place O
. O

However, O
researchers O
proposed O
several O
possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
results O
: O
They O
theorised O
that O
screen-viewing O
time O
displaces O
physical O
activities O
in O
boys, O
resulting O
more O
sedentary O
behaviour O
. O

Comparatively, O
girls O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
engage O
in O
non-screen-based O
sedentary O
behaviour, O
so O
the O
impact O
of O
screen-viewing O
time O
may O
not O
be O
as O
pronounced O
on O
latter O
. O

"Boys O
might O
be O
naturally O
or O
socially O
encouraged O
to O
engage O
in O
physical O
activity O
when O
not O
watching O
screen O
devices O
. O

In O
contrast, O
girls O
might O
engage O
in O
other O
sedentary O
activities O
more O
frequently, O
as O
reported O
a O
study O
with O
older O
children," O

many O

this O

And O
the O

to O

according O

is O
in O

the O
