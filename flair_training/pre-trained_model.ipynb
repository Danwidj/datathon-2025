    "Background Information\n",
    "The Kosovo citizen, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative, is the owner and Director of the\n",
    "Pristina-based Vendor 1 and also a 51% shareholder of the Pristina-Ljubljana-based company\n",

    "Both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 submitted three times in 2003 for the same tenders:\n",
    "1. Supply and Mounting of Sonic System in the Fire Station Building. Winner was Vendor\n",
    "2 with €1,530 followed by Vendor 1 with €1,620. The third company, Vendor 3, did not\n",

    "\n",
    "3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on\n",
    "the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators\n",
    "conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons\n",
    "indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by\n",
    "obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,\n",
    "which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under\n",
    "Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal\n",
    "buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period\n",
    "covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the\n",
    "Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the\n",
    "Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution\n",
    "1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.\n",
    "UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned\n",
    "and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.\n",
    "5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina\n",
    "Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,\n",
    "including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport\n",
    "and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport\n",
    "Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left\n",
    "UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    "international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,\n",
    "reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.\n",
    "Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the\n",
    "armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1,\n",
    "Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later by the Consultant from the\n",
    "Consulting Firm.\n",
    "6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed\n",
    "from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional\n",
    "Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him\n",
    "were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.\n",
    "7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been\n",
    "under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under\n",
    "ICAO regulations.\n",
    "8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to\n",
    "the following contract have been examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "III. INVESTIGATION DETAILS\n",
    "\n",
    "9. This part of the investigation relates to two tenders for a contract, for the supply\n",
    "of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was\n",
    "€180,816.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allegation 1\n",
    "\n",
    "(It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no\n",
    "proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by\n",
    "\n",
    "companies submitting bids in the first tender)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April\n",
    "2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a\n",
    "company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003.\n",
    "However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional\n",
    "Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003\n",
    "confirms that this tender was cancelled.\n",
    "11. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1\n",
    "stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken\n",
    "from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result\n",
    "of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was\n",
    "of the most expensive type. (See below allegation 2)\n",
    "12. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked\n",
    "the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that\n",
    "the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the\n",
    "cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added\n",
    "that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper\n",
    "description of the cabins in their bid documents.\n",

    "been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation\n",

    "came at a high price.\n",
    "\n",
    "IV. FINDINGS OF FACT\n",
    "\n",
    "24. The first tender for cleaning machines was cancelled due to alleged deficiencies\n",
    "in the description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted\n",
    "and the fact that a brochure from the Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the\n",
    "technical specifications for the cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that\n",
    "the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company,\n",
    "namely Vendor 1.\n",
    "25. The second tender was not awarded due to concerns that the technical\n",
    "specifications produced from the brochure of Vendor 1 had given an unfair\n",
    "advantage to one company; and doubts as to the high purchase cost of the\n",
    "cleaning machines which met the specification criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\n",
    "\n",
    "V. CONCLUSIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "26. On the available information, the decision leading to the cancellation of the first\n",
    "tender was correct, since concerns had been raised concerning both the\n",
    "descriptions of the machines to be purchased and the fact that a brochure from\n",
    "Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technical specifications for the\n",
    "cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications\n",
    "had given an unfair advantage to one company in breach of Article 15.1 of\n",
    "UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using\n",
    "Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. The reasons for the second tender not proceeding appear to be well founded if\n",
    "concerns were expressed over the offer price and the technical specification.\n",
    "However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether in this instance, the\n",
    "use of technical specifications from a particular company brochure was a\n",
    "deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or due to ignorance of the\n",
    "regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "VI. RECOMMENDATION\n",
    "\n",
    "28. Based on the above information, the ITF recommends that UNMIK refer this\n",
    "report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deemed appropriate with regard to\n",
    "ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders do not utilise technical\n",
    "specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the\n",
    "course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01).\n",
