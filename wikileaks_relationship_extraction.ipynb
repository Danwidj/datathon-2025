       "'Alleged misappropriation of funds – Manager (Case No. 050/04) The Investigation Task Force (ITF) has been investigating an allegation regarding administrative irregularities regarding the insurance coverage for Pristina Airport by a London-based Company, who then purchased the cover from Insurance Company 1 between 2001 and 2003. Based on extensive documentation obtained from UNMIK Pillar II, the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Public Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), the ITF determined that the responsible Manager did not undertake efforts in 2002 or 2003 to invite international tenders for the Airport’s insurance coverage. According to UNMIK regulations 1999/2 – Finance Administration Instruction on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Funds – and in view of the cost of the premiums of more than $125,000 USD, such a tender should have been undertaken. The Manager did not prepare an international tender for at least the period 2 October 2003 to 1 October 2004, instead, he concluded a contract in favour of Insurance Company 1 effecting insurance coverage pertaining to Pristina International Airport for a further year. It should be considered as to whether this conduct demonstrates probable cause with regard to the waste or misappropriation of public funds. Such an issue should be determined by a review of the matter by the Department of Justice.'"
